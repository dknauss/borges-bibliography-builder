# Planning Documents

Forward-looking engineering plans, sprint roadmaps, and area-specific
specifications that supplement the authoritative `SPEC.md` at the repo root.

## What goes here

-   Multi-sprint roadmaps for major areas of work (e.g., sort conformance,
    accessibility hardening, performance refactors)
-   Area-specific specifications that elaborate on `SPEC.md` without replacing
    it
-   Ticket-style requirement breakdowns ready for the issue tracker
-   Options analyses and architectural decision records related to in-flight
    planning

## What does NOT go here

-   The authoritative plugin specification → `SPEC.md` at repo root
-   QA checklists and matrices → flat `docs/` (e.g., `qa-matrix-checklist.md`)
-   Manual test artifacts and samples → flat `docs/` (e.g.,
    `free-text-samples.md`)
-   Audit records → `docs/a11y-audit-records/` and similar category folders
-   Release operational checklists → flat `docs/` (e.g.,
    `release-readiness-checklist.md`, `wporg-svn-checklist.md`)

## Conventions

Each planning document should include:

1. A status header (drafted date, current state, owner, stakeholders)
2. A TL;DR summary
3. Sprint or phase breakdown when work spans multiple iterations
4. Self-contained ticket-style requirements that can be lifted to the issue
   tracker
5. A revision history table at the bottom

When a plan is fully delivered, archive it by moving to `docs/planning/archive/`
rather than deleting, so the historical context remains accessible.
